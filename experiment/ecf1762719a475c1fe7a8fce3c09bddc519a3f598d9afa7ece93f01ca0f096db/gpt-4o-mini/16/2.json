            "content": "You are going to play a text adventure game. All of the user's input\nrepresents text printed by the game. Your output will be interpreted\nas commands issued to the game. However, the game will ignore\nanything you put in parentheses. Use parentheticals to record your\nthoughts as you think step-by-step through these instructions before\nyou decide what move to make. Every time you enter a new room, begin\nyour next thought by listing what exits you see.\n\nThe game you will be playing is randomly generated, but all games\nfollow the same simple template. Your goal is to prepare and eat a\nmeal. To do this, you will perform the following, three-phase\nprocedure.\n\n# Phase I: Find the kitchen\n\nExplore the map until you locate the kitchen. Use compass commands\n`N`, `S`, `E`, and `W` to move around. There may be doors in your\nway. Use the command `OPEN <adjective> DOOR` to open them,\nsubstituting whatever adjective you see in the room description.\n\nWhen you explore, pay careful attention to any occurrence of \"north\",\n\"south\", \"east\", or \"west\" in a room description. These words always\nindicate room exits. Explore all exits until you've located\neverything you need.\n\nDuring this phase, make a note of any items you come across, but do\nnot pick any of them up.\n\n# Phase II: Search for ingredients\n\nOnce you find the kitchen, use the command `READ COOKBOOK`. The\ncookbook will contain a list of ingredients, and then a list of\ndirections for preparation. Right now, just pay attention to the\nlist of ingredients. Don't worry about preparation until Phase III.\n\nNext, use the command `I` to list your inventory. You may already be\ncarrying some of the ingredients you need. If you are carrying\nanything that you *don't* need, use the `DROP` command to drop it.\nYou may find some items in your inventory that you didn't pick up,\nwhich were there at the start of the game. This is normal.\n\nThird, use the command `OPEN FRIDGE`. If the fridge contains any\ningredients you need, use the `GET` command to pick them up.\n\nNow, figure out what ingredients you are still missing, and then\ncontinue exploring the map until you find them.\n\nPick up only the ingredients that the recipe calls for. Pay\nattention to their entire description. For example, if the recipe\ncalls for a red pepper, don't pick up a yellow pepper unles the\nrecipe needs that too.\n\nIf you try to pick something up and the game tells you, \"You're\ncarrying too many things already\", you've messed up: either you're\ncarrying something you don't need, or you don't need the thing\nyou're trying to pick up.  Check your inventory again (use `I`),\ncompare your inventory against the recipe, and `DROP` any\nunnecessary items.\n\nIf you get lost or stuck in a loop while exploring in Phase II,\nremember the principles from Phase I: look for \"north\", \"south\",\n\"east\", and \"west\" in room descriptions to make sure you haven't\noverlooked any exits. If you notice a closed door, that's certainly\na way you haven't explored yet.\n\n# Phase III: Prepare your meal\n\nOnce you have all your ingredients, return to the kitchen. Now\n`READ COOKBOOK` again, and then check your inventory again.\nDouble-check that your inventory contains all the required\ningredients and nothing else. If you made a mistake, return to\nphase II and correct it.\n\nNow you are ready to follow the directions in the cookbook. Each\nstep except the last one in the list of directions is either a\ncutting step, or a cooking step. A cutting step calls for you either\nto *slice*, *dice*, or *chop* an ingredient. A cooking step calls\nfor you either to *roast*, *fry*, or *grill* an ingredient.\n\nDetermine if any steps involve cutting. If and only if you need to\ncut anything, use `GET KNIFE` to pick up the knife. You might have\nto drop something first to make room for the knife in your inventory.\n\nNow, follow the directions in order and follow them exactly. Use the\nfollowing commands:\n\n* If the cookbook says to *slice* an ingredient, use `SLICE <ingredient> WITH KNIFE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *dice* an ingredient, use `DICE <ingredient> WITH KNIFE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *chop* an ingredient, use `CHOP <ingredient> WITH KNIFE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *roast* an ingredient, use `COOK <ingredient> WITH OVEN`.\n* If the cookbook says to *fry* an ingredient, use `COOK <ingredient> WITH STOVE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *grill* an ingredient, use `COOK <ingredient> WITH BBQ`.\n\nBe careful to use the right verb for cutting and the right appliance\nfor cooking! If you slice something that you should have diced or\nchopped, or if you roast something that you should have fried or\ngrilled, you'll lose the game. Also be sure not to cook any\ningredient more than once, or you'll burn it.\n\nEverything you need for meal preparation is in the kitchen, except\nfor the BBQ. The BBQ is in the backyard. So, if you have to grill\nsomething, you will have to go to the backyard first and then return\nto the kitchen afterward. After you get back to the kitchen, you\nshould `READ COOKBOOK` again so you can remember where you left off.\n\nThe final step in the list of directions will be \"prepare meal\", so\nonce you have done everything else, use `PREPARE MEAL` to put the\ningredients together; make sure you're still holding them all. You\ncan drop the knife now if you need to. Finally, use the command\n`EAT MEAL` to win the game, and then `QUIT`.",

            "content": "Well done! Now play a new game. Your instructions are the same as before:\n\nYou are going to play a text adventure game. All of the user's input\nrepresents text printed by the game. Your output will be interpreted\nas commands issued to the game. However, the game will ignore\nanything you put in parentheses. Use parentheticals to record your\nthoughts as you think step-by-step through these instructions before\nyou decide what move to make. Every time you enter a new room, begin\nyour next thought by listing what exits you see.\n\nThe game you will be playing is randomly generated, but all games\nfollow the same simple template. Your goal is to prepare and eat a\nmeal. To do this, you will perform the following, three-phase\nprocedure.\n\n# Phase I: Find the kitchen\n\nExplore the map until you locate the kitchen. Use compass commands\n`N`, `S`, `E`, and `W` to move around. There may be doors in your\nway. Use the command `OPEN <adjective> DOOR` to open them,\nsubstituting whatever adjective you see in the room description.\n\nWhen you explore, pay careful attention to any occurrence of \"north\",\n\"south\", \"east\", or \"west\" in a room description. These words always\nindicate room exits. Explore all exits until you've located\neverything you need.\n\nDuring this phase, make a note of any items you come across, but do\nnot pick any of them up.\n\n# Phase II: Search for ingredients\n\nOnce you find the kitchen, use the command `READ COOKBOOK`. The\ncookbook will contain a list of ingredients, and then a list of\ndirections for preparation. Right now, just pay attention to the\nlist of ingredients. Don't worry about preparation until Phase III.\n\nNext, use the command `I` to list your inventory. You may already be\ncarrying some of the ingredients you need. If you are carrying\nanything that you *don't* need, use the `DROP` command to drop it.\nYou may find some items in your inventory that you didn't pick up,\nwhich were there at the start of the game. This is normal.\n\nThird, use the command `OPEN FRIDGE`. If the fridge contains any\ningredients you need, use the `GET` command to pick them up.\n\nNow, figure out what ingredients you are still missing, and then\ncontinue exploring the map until you find them.\n\nPick up only the ingredients that the recipe calls for. Pay\nattention to their entire description. For example, if the recipe\ncalls for a red pepper, don't pick up a yellow pepper unles the\nrecipe needs that too.\n\nIf you try to pick something up and the game tells you, \"You're\ncarrying too many things already\", you've messed up: either you're\ncarrying something you don't need, or you don't need the thing\nyou're trying to pick up.  Check your inventory again (use `I`),\ncompare your inventory against the recipe, and `DROP` any\nunnecessary items.\n\nIf you get lost or stuck in a loop while exploring in Phase II,\nremember the principles from Phase I: look for \"north\", \"south\",\n\"east\", and \"west\" in room descriptions to make sure you haven't\noverlooked any exits. If you notice a closed door, that's certainly\na way you haven't explored yet.\n\n# Phase III: Prepare your meal\n\nOnce you have all your ingredients, return to the kitchen. Now\n`READ COOKBOOK` again, and then check your inventory again.\nDouble-check that your inventory contains all the required\ningredients and nothing else. If you made a mistake, return to\nphase II and correct it.\n\nNow you are ready to follow the directions in the cookbook. Each\nstep except the last one in the list of directions is either a\ncutting step, or a cooking step. A cutting step calls for you either\nto *slice*, *dice*, or *chop* an ingredient. A cooking step calls\nfor you either to *roast*, *fry*, or *grill* an ingredient.\n\nDetermine if any steps involve cutting. If and only if you need to\ncut anything, use `GET KNIFE` to pick up the knife. You might have\nto drop something first to make room for the knife in your inventory.\n\nNow, follow the directions in order and follow them exactly. Use the\nfollowing commands:\n\n* If the cookbook says to *slice* an ingredient, use `SLICE <ingredient> WITH KNIFE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *dice* an ingredient, use `DICE <ingredient> WITH KNIFE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *chop* an ingredient, use `CHOP <ingredient> WITH KNIFE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *roast* an ingredient, use `COOK <ingredient> WITH OVEN`.\n* If the cookbook says to *fry* an ingredient, use `COOK <ingredient> WITH STOVE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *grill* an ingredient, use `COOK <ingredient> WITH BBQ`.\n\nBe careful to use the right verb for cutting and the right appliance\nfor cooking! If you slice something that you should have diced or\nchopped, or if you roast something that you should have fried or\ngrilled, you'll lose the game. Also be sure not to cook any\ningredient more than once, or you'll burn it.\n\nEverything you need for meal preparation is in the kitchen, except\nfor the BBQ. The BBQ is in the backyard. So, if you have to grill\nsomething, you will have to go to the backyard first and then return\nto the kitchen afterward. After you get back to the kitchen, you\nshould `READ COOKBOOK` again so you can remember where you left off.\n\nThe final step in the list of directions will be \"prepare meal\", so\nonce you have done everything else, use `PREPARE MEAL` to put the\ningredients together; make sure you're still holding them all. You\ncan drop the knife now if you need to. Finally, use the command\n`EAT MEAL` to win the game, and then `QUIT`.",
