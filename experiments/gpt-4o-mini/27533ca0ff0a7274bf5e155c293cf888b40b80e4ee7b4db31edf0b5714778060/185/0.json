            "content": "You are going to play a text adventure game. All of the user's input represents\ntext printed by the game. On each turn, consider the information that was just\npresented to you, plan your next move, and then make it. Place your thoughts\ninside parentheses, and then outside those parentheses, issue a command to the\ngame. The game will interpret all of, and only, what is not parenthesized as a\ncommand.\n\nMaintain a calm and coherent tone at all times. Although the game's prose is often\nawkward and disjointed, you should not imitate that style.\n\nThe game you will be playing is randomly generated, but all games follow the\nsame simple template. Your goal is to prepare and eat a meal. To do this, you\nwill perform a three-phase procedure. In the first phase, you will search for\nthe kitchen. In the second phase, you will read the cookbook to determine what\ningredients you need and then gather those ingredients. In the third phase,\nyou will return to the kitchen with the ingredients and then prepare and eat\nthe meal.\n\n# Phase I: Find the kitchen\n\nExplore the map until you locate the kitchen. Use compass commands `N`, `S`,\n`E`, and `W` to move around. There may be doors in your way. Use the command\n`OPEN <adjective> DOOR` to open them, substituting whatever adjective you see in\nthe room description.\n\nWhen you explore, pay careful attention to any occurrence of \"north\", \"south\",\n\"east\", or \"west\" in a room description. These words always indicate room exits.\nStructure your exploration systematically and \"depth-first\", preferring first to\nexplore new avenues but backtracking once you've exhausted any particular\nbranch.\n\nDuring this phase, make a note of any items you come across, but do not pick any\nof them up.\n\n# Phase II: Search for ingredients\n\nOnce you find the kitchen, use the command `READ COOKBOOK`. The cookbook will\ncontain a list of ingredients, and then a list of directions for preparation.\nRight now, just pay attention to the list of ingredients. Don't worry about\npreparation until Phase III.\n\nNext, use the command `I` to list your inventory. You may already be carrying\nsome of the ingredients you need. If you are carrying anything that you *don't*\nneed, use the `DROP` command to drop it. You may find some items in your\ninventory that you didn't pick up, which were there at the start of the game.\nThis is normal.\n\nThird, use the command `OPEN FRIDGE`. If the fridge contains any ingredients you\nneed, use the `GET` command to pick them up.\n\nNow, figure out what ingredients you are still missing, and then continue\nexploring the map until you find them. Resume your exploration in the same\nsystematic fashion that you began it in the earlier phase.\n\nPick up only the ingredients that the recipe calls for. Pay attention to their\nentire description. For example, if the recipe calls for a red pepper, don't\npick up a yellow pepper unles the recipe needs that too.\n\nIf you try to pick something up and the game tells you, \"You're carrying too\nmany things already\", you've messed up: either you're carrying something you\ndon't need, or you don't need the thing you're trying to pick up.  Check your\ninventory again (use `I`), compare your inventory against the recipe, and `DROP`\nany unnecessary items.\n\nIf you get stuck searching for an ingredient, don't give up: it's always\nsomewhere accessible and there's probably somewhere you forgot to explore.\nInstead of wandering in circles, try clearing your mind and beginning a fresh,\nsystematic, depth-first traversal of the whole map.\n\n\n# Phase III: Prepare your meal\n\nOnce you have all your ingredients, return to the kitchen. Now `READ COOKBOOK`\nagain, and then check your inventory again. Double-check that your inventory\ncontains all the required ingredients and nothing else. If you made a mistake,\nreturn to phase II and correct it.\n\nNow you are ready to follow the directions in the cookbook. Each step except the\nlast one in the list of directions is either a cutting step, or a cooking step.\nA cutting step calls for you either to *slice*, *dice*, or *chop* an ingredient.\nA cooking step calls for you either to *roast*, *fry*, or *grill* an ingredient.\n\nDetermine if any steps involve cutting. If and only if you need to cut anything,\nuse `GET KNIFE` to pick up the knife. You might have to drop something first to\nmake room for the knife in your inventory.\n\nNow, follow the directions in order and follow them exactly. Use the following\ncommands:\n\n* If the cookbook says to *slice* an ingredient, use `SLICE <ingredient> WITH KNIFE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *dice* an ingredient, use `DICE <ingredient> WITH KNIFE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *chop* an ingredient, use `CHOP <ingredient> WITH KNIFE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *roast* an ingredient, use `COOK <ingredient> WITH OVEN`.\n* If the cookbook says to *fry* an ingredient, use `COOK <ingredient> WITH STOVE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *grill* an ingredient, use `COOK <ingredient> WITH BBQ`.\n\nBe careful to use the right verb for cutting and the right appliance for\ncooking! If you slice something that you should have diced or chopped, or if you\nroast something that you should have fried or grilled, you'll lose the game.\nAlso be sure not to cook any ingredient more than once, or you'll burn it.\n\nEverything you need for meal preparation is in the kitchen, except for the BBQ.\nThe BBQ is in the backyard. So, if you have to grill something, you will have to\ngo to the backyard first and then return to the kitchen afterward. After you get\nback to the kitchen, you should `READ COOKBOOK` again so you can remember where\nyou left off.\n\nThe final step in the list of directions will be \"prepare meal\", so once you\nhave done everything else, use `PREPARE MEAL` to put the ingredients together;\nmake sure you're still holding them all. You can drop the knife now if you need\nto. Finally, use the command `EAT MEAL` to win the game, and then `QUIT`.",

            "content": "Well done! Now play again. Your instructions are the same as before:\n\nYou are going to play a text adventure game. All of the user's input represents\ntext printed by the game. On each turn, consider the information that was just\npresented to you, plan your next move, and then make it. Place your thoughts\ninside parentheses, and then outside those parentheses, issue a command to the\ngame. The game will interpret all of, and only, what is not parenthesized as a\ncommand.\n\nMaintain a calm and coherent tone at all times. Although the game's prose is often\nawkward and disjointed, you should not imitate that style.\n\nThe game you will be playing is randomly generated, but all games follow the\nsame simple template. Your goal is to prepare and eat a meal. To do this, you\nwill perform a three-phase procedure. In the first phase, you will search for\nthe kitchen. In the second phase, you will read the cookbook to determine what\ningredients you need and then gather those ingredients. In the third phase,\nyou will return to the kitchen with the ingredients and then prepare and eat\nthe meal.\n\n# Phase I: Find the kitchen\n\nExplore the map until you locate the kitchen. Use compass commands `N`, `S`,\n`E`, and `W` to move around. There may be doors in your way. Use the command\n`OPEN <adjective> DOOR` to open them, substituting whatever adjective you see in\nthe room description.\n\nWhen you explore, pay careful attention to any occurrence of \"north\", \"south\",\n\"east\", or \"west\" in a room description. These words always indicate room exits.\nStructure your exploration systematically and \"depth-first\", preferring first to\nexplore new avenues but backtracking once you've exhausted any particular\nbranch.\n\nDuring this phase, make a note of any items you come across, but do not pick any\nof them up.\n\n# Phase II: Search for ingredients\n\nOnce you find the kitchen, use the command `READ COOKBOOK`. The cookbook will\ncontain a list of ingredients, and then a list of directions for preparation.\nRight now, just pay attention to the list of ingredients. Don't worry about\npreparation until Phase III.\n\nNext, use the command `I` to list your inventory. You may already be carrying\nsome of the ingredients you need. If you are carrying anything that you *don't*\nneed, use the `DROP` command to drop it. You may find some items in your\ninventory that you didn't pick up, which were there at the start of the game.\nThis is normal.\n\nThird, use the command `OPEN FRIDGE`. If the fridge contains any ingredients you\nneed, use the `GET` command to pick them up.\n\nNow, figure out what ingredients you are still missing, and then continue\nexploring the map until you find them. Resume your exploration in the same\nsystematic fashion that you began it in the earlier phase.\n\nPick up only the ingredients that the recipe calls for. Pay attention to their\nentire description. For example, if the recipe calls for a red pepper, don't\npick up a yellow pepper unles the recipe needs that too.\n\nIf you try to pick something up and the game tells you, \"You're carrying too\nmany things already\", you've messed up: either you're carrying something you\ndon't need, or you don't need the thing you're trying to pick up.  Check your\ninventory again (use `I`), compare your inventory against the recipe, and `DROP`\nany unnecessary items.\n\nIf you get stuck searching for an ingredient, don't give up: it's always\nsomewhere accessible and there's probably somewhere you forgot to explore.\nInstead of wandering in circles, try clearing your mind and beginning a fresh,\nsystematic, depth-first traversal of the whole map.\n\n\n# Phase III: Prepare your meal\n\nOnce you have all your ingredients, return to the kitchen. Now `READ COOKBOOK`\nagain, and then check your inventory again. Double-check that your inventory\ncontains all the required ingredients and nothing else. If you made a mistake,\nreturn to phase II and correct it.\n\nNow you are ready to follow the directions in the cookbook. Each step except the\nlast one in the list of directions is either a cutting step, or a cooking step.\nA cutting step calls for you either to *slice*, *dice*, or *chop* an ingredient.\nA cooking step calls for you either to *roast*, *fry*, or *grill* an ingredient.\n\nDetermine if any steps involve cutting. If and only if you need to cut anything,\nuse `GET KNIFE` to pick up the knife. You might have to drop something first to\nmake room for the knife in your inventory.\n\nNow, follow the directions in order and follow them exactly. Use the following\ncommands:\n\n* If the cookbook says to *slice* an ingredient, use `SLICE <ingredient> WITH KNIFE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *dice* an ingredient, use `DICE <ingredient> WITH KNIFE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *chop* an ingredient, use `CHOP <ingredient> WITH KNIFE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *roast* an ingredient, use `COOK <ingredient> WITH OVEN`.\n* If the cookbook says to *fry* an ingredient, use `COOK <ingredient> WITH STOVE`.\n* If the cookbook says to *grill* an ingredient, use `COOK <ingredient> WITH BBQ`.\n\nBe careful to use the right verb for cutting and the right appliance for\ncooking! If you slice something that you should have diced or chopped, or if you\nroast something that you should have fried or grilled, you'll lose the game.\nAlso be sure not to cook any ingredient more than once, or you'll burn it.\n\nEverything you need for meal preparation is in the kitchen, except for the BBQ.\nThe BBQ is in the backyard. So, if you have to grill something, you will have to\ngo to the backyard first and then return to the kitchen afterward. After you get\nback to the kitchen, you should `READ COOKBOOK` again so you can remember where\nyou left off.\n\nThe final step in the list of directions will be \"prepare meal\", so once you\nhave done everything else, use `PREPARE MEAL` to put the ingredients together;\nmake sure you're still holding them all. You can drop the knife now if you need\nto. Finally, use the command `EAT MEAL` to win the game, and then `QUIT`.",
